This project is a React-based web application designed to help users manage emergency contacts and share their live location with those contacts. 
The project includes several key features, organized into different pages:

1. User Login Page:-

       Purpose: This page allows users to log in by entering their name and phone number.

       Phone Validation: It ensures that the entered phone number is exactly 10 digits. If the input exceeds 10 digits, an error message is displayed.

       Navigation: Upon entering valid details, users are redirected to the Location Tracker Page.

2. Location Tracker Page:-

       Purpose: Fetches the user's current geographical location using the browser's Geolocation API.

       Map Display: Shows the user's location on a Google Maps embedded frame, based on latitude and longitude.

       Error Handling: If location services are unavailable or permission is denied, an error message is shown.

       Navigation: Users can navigate to the Manage Contacts Page using a button.

3. Manage Contacts Page:-

       Purpose: Allows users to add, edit, and delete emergency contacts.

       Contact Management:

         i.)Add/Edit Contacts: Users can add new contacts by entering a name and a 10-digit phone number. Contacts can also be edited.

         ii.)Delete Contacts: Provides a button to remove a contact.

      Error Handling: Ensures that the entered phone number doesn't exceed 10 digits, displaying an error message if it does.

      Location Sharing:
         Users can select a contact and click a button to share their current location.
         The location is shared as a Google Maps link containing the user's latitude and longitude.
         After sharing the location, a success message with a tick mark is displayed.

      Navigation: Includes a button to return to the Location Tracker Page.

4. Additional Features

      Phone Number Validation: Integrated across both the user login and manage contacts page to ensure consistency.

      Local Storage: Stores contacts using local storage to persist the data even after refreshing the page.

      Success Feedback: Provides visual feedback when actions like sharing a location are completed successfully.

      Responsive Design: The application uses CSS for basic styling and is designed to be responsive on various screen sizes.

Technologies Used:-

      React: For building the user interface and handling state management.

      JavaScript: For handling geolocation data and dynamic interactions.

      Google Maps Embed API: To display the user's location on a map.
